Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.

•Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to your desktop and rename the folder with "UCI_HAR_ Dataset".

•Use source command to execute run_analysis.R in RStudio. 

•You will find two output files. An intermediate file "result_data.txt" and the final file "result_tidy_data.txt". You can use the command read.table to read the file.
